I am a Nigerian student at Oberlin College, and an alum of the African Leadership Academy in Johannesburg, South Africa. An avid reader, writer, and researcher, I aim to utilize these skills in collaboration with one another to create an equitable and sustainable African future. 

As an Africana Studies major with minors in Politics and Religion, my passions lay in harnessing my education toward using politics and academia as a tool for development in the African context. In essence, I aim to create safer spaces for marginalized identities across the Continent through the work that I do.
